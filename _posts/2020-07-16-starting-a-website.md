There are various ways to build a webisite. It seemed very daunting to me and I didn't know where to begin so I started exploring different ways to see what worked for me.  I am still learning and exploring. A few ways to build a website are listed below.

1. I have used the Jekyll option. I have used the [Jekyll now](https://github.com/eshanis/jekyll-now) and the template directly on github. More details can be found [here.](https://blog.eshani.ml/github-website/).

2. 

4. You can start building a website from scratch. This means creating HTML, CSS and Java Script. This is a very painful process but a great way to learn. This one I have  not tried yet.
