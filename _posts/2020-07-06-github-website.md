## Setting up a website on Github


-Step 1: Select a website. The one I picked is minimal mistakes.

https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter

-Step 2 : The next step is to Fork it. Doing this makes a copy. You can then make the 
              changes you need. The Fork button is to the left of the screen.

**Step 3 : Customize and change the repository name to youname.github.io
             To do this, click on the settings button.

**Step 4 : Scroll down to the Github pages to publish
        
**Step 5 : To edit the pages Use a third party GitHub content editor, like Prose by Development Seed. 
             It is optimized for use, making markdown editing, writing drafts and uploading images really easy.   
          
**Step 6** : GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with mmistakes. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a 
             few seconds later at https://yourgithubusername.github.io - 
             if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon
