Sometimes you want to put links to others people's pages or pages within your own website.

For this, you use the "a" tags
```
<a href= "the_site_you_want_to_link"> The  Name of the site </a>
```
For example, if you want to link to my github page:
```
 <a href="https://github.com/eshanis">  
    github Page      
 </a>
```

Sometimes, you want to open the page in a new tab, so the user doesnt lose your page. Use "target=_blank"
```
<a href= "the_site_you_want_to_link" target="_blank"> The  Name of the site you want to link to </a>
```
As example:
```
<a href="https://github.com/eshanis"  target="_blank" title="star my github!">      
	github Page       
</a>
```
You may have noticed a title inside the opening "a" tag. This title shows up when you hover over the link

In case you want to make an image as the thing you want the user to click to take them to another link, 
```
<a href="https://github.com/eshanis"  target="_blank" title="star my github!">
       
	<img .....         
</a>

```

If you have many pages in your website and you want to link to another page, you can do :
```

```
So here's a complete example:
