Hello!
When I started, I was so overwhelmed with all the options out there and trying to figure out how to host a website without spending a ton of money, it took me awhile to get here. Hope this blog makes it easier for you to build your website. This blog is a step by step guide to building a website using [typerite](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/typerite/).

**Step 1.** I downloaded the files from [typerite](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/typerite/) onto my comupter as a zipped folder.

**Step 2.** I used [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) to edit the files. When you open the files using Brackets, you need to unzip the folder. I used Brackets for couple of different reasons

-it gives me a live preview of the changes I make right next to the editor. To got to live preview, click on the drop down menu for file and select "live preview".

-it lets me edit CSS files in the Index folder using the quck edit option when you right click on the down arrow.

**Step 3.** Once the editing is completed, I uploaded the website to [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/)
