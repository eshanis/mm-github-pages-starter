** 1. Webhosting Options**

There are many webserver options. The ones I used were :

a.[aws](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) - Amazon Web Services

This involved many steps and I had to pay for this service after my free account for a year was used up.

b.[github pages](https://blog.eshani.ml/) I created this website as my tech blog on Github pages. You can find the code to my website [here](https://github.com/eshanis/eshanis.github.io). You can find details on how to set up [here](https://blog.eshani.ml/github-website/) I got my free domain on [freenom](https://my.freenom.com/clientarea.php?action=domains)
