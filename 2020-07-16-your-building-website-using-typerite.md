Hello!
This blog is a step by step guide to build a website using [typerite](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/typerite/). Hope this blog makes it easier for you to build your website.

1. I downloaded the files from [typerite](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/typerite/) onto my comupter as a zipped folder.

2. I used [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) to edit the files. I used Brackets for couple of different reasons

-it gives me a live preview of the changes I make right next to the editor. To got to live preview, click on the drop down menu for file and select "live preview".

-it lets me edit CSS files in the Index folder using the quck edit option when you right click on the down arrow.
When you open the files using Brackets, you need to unzip the folder.
